# Join-Us

This is a small group for tech enthusiasts specially for research from various domains. The main moto is to bring like-minded people from technical research under one roof, where we could write and collabrate on research papers and projects. One way to join us is to create an issue on this repo and let us know your willingness to join us, your prior experience in coding and what contributions would you like to do to this Github organization.
